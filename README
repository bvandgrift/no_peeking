= No Peeking

This extension adds a checkbox to the page editor, allowing a user to 
specify that the page cannot be reached from a deep link from outside
the home site.  It check the incoming referrer (referer) and redirects
to the site's home page if it is not the expected site url.

NOTE: if you are using an extension which has futzed with site_controller's
show_uncached_page method, there may be complication.
