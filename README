= No Peeking

This extension adds a checkbox to the page editor, allowing a user to 
specify that the page cannot be reached from a deep link from outside
the home site.  It checks the incoming referrer (http_referer) and redirects
to the site's home page if its host is not the same as the site's host.

NOTE: if you are using an extension which has futzed with site_controller's
show_uncached_page method, there may be complication.

The basic rules: for a 'no peeking' page, the referring host has to 
match the target host.  www.example.com referring to example.com would
fail, and redirect back to /.
